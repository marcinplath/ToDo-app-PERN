## Project Status
Project is: in progress
The main functionalities (task management, user authentication, and priority-based filtering) are working. Future improvements include more complex task creation(date) and enhanced UI.

## Room for Improvement

Areas to improve:
Add real-time notifications for task deadlines using WebSockets.
Role-based access for administrators and regular users.
Integration with a calendar API for better task visualization.
###To-do:
Allow users to view task history.
Improve UI with animations and transitions.
